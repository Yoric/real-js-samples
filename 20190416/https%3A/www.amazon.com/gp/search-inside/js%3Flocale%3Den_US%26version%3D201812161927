"WHAT_IS_BROWSING_HISTORY":'What is \'Your Book Browsing History\'?'
,
"NEED_TO_SIGN_IN_ANSWER":'No, but some features and pages are available only if you are logged into your Amazon account and have made a prior purchase.  For those customers who choose not to log in or who have not made their first purchase with us, we still provide a helpful set of preview pages within the book.'
,
"MY_PRIOR_PURCHASE_ANSWER":'No. Any item sold by Amazon.com will do. (Digital items and items purchased from another seller through the Amazon site do not qualify at this time.)  You must have a shipped order in your order history.  If you need assistance changing your e-mail address or recovering your password on your old account, please contact Customer Service.'
,
"SLIGHTLY_DIFFERENT_CONTENT_ANSWER":'Some book previews are linked to a related edition of the book that we have scanned. We typically scan only one version and share the page images between both books, since the text is otherwise identical. If this is the case, we will indicate the version of the book that the text comes from.'
,
"ADJUST_SIZE_TEXT_ANSWER":'Absolutely! If the default text size is too large or too small, just click the zoom icons to zoom in or out. You can also "grab" the image, drag and pan when zoomed in.'
,
"SEARCH_MORE_EFFECTIVELY_ANSWER":'If you\'re searching for a specific phrase instead of a collection of keywords, put quotation marks around the phrase (for example, "left-handed pitchers"). This will bring up a shorter, more targeted list of results than searching for those two words without quotation marks.'
,
"PROVIDE_FEEDBACK_ANSWER":'We value your feedback as an ongoing source of ideas to improve the program. You can use the feedback link at the top right of the Reader for any book.'
,
"WHAT_IS_BROWSING_HISTORY_ANSWER":'Your Book Browsing History helps you keep track of books you\'ve recently viewed. Your Browsing History is continually updated to include your most recently viewed items. To clear your recent history, visit <a href="/gp/yourstore/pym/">Your Browsing History</a> and click the "Delete this item" link located next to each item. To remove all items, click the "Delete All" button in the left column. We hope you find Your Browsing History useful. If you do not enjoy this feature and want to turn it off, <a href="/gp/yourstore/pym/cc/">click here</a>.'
